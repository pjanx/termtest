termtest
========

'termtest' is a tool to test the terminal's features in a semi-automated way.

I considered writing this in Python but it has a shitty curses library where you
need to call `initscr()` before anything else.  Overall, it is a good idea to
avoid such layers on top of the terminfo library.

Using
-----
Build dependencies: a C99 compiler (tcc is guaranteed to work) +
Runtime dependencies: ncurses

 $ git clone https://git.janouch.name/p/termtest.git

 $ ./termtest
